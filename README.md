# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

## This is my Engineering Leader README
*Working with Scott? Here's what to expect!*

Caveats:
* I'm pretty aware of my faults - this document isn't my attempt at excusing them.
* This document also [isn't an attempt to build trust](https://medium.com/@skamille/i-hate-manager-readmes-20a0dd9a70d0). That happens as we work together.
* This also isn't everything - this is just a start to get going.

## Who _are_ you?
* [Small-town](https://cityofpage.org/) raised, lived-all-over, Millennial-leaning Gen-Xer who loves [music](https://twitter.com/search?q=%40tapH20guru%20mixtape&src=typed_query), cooking, dad jokes, and technology.
* I'm pretty much [down the middle blue/green](https://www.wearebowline.com/blog/8-personality-types-a-deeper-dive-into-insights-discovery/). (Supporting or Observing Coordinator)
* I'm [ISTJ](https://www.truity.com/personality-type/ISTJ)-ish.

## Guiding Principals, Things I Value and Fun Trinkets
* Pragmatist - What works for our team? People > Process. True [Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/)!
* Overcommunicate - [No going dark](https://blog.codinghorror.com/dont-go-dark/) - It's ok to say things more than once - Written communication helps solidify your thoughts (see: https://basecamp.com/guides/how-we-communicate #6 and #7).
* [Dig yourself (and others) a pit of success](https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/)
* Continuous improvement - Little by little let's make things better
* Process is good - When it's just enough to ease the pain and no more
* When it comes to human interaction, boring is bad. Emojis, gifs and cool project names are it.
* When it comes to technology [boring](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology) [is](https://boringrails.com/) [good](http://boringtechnology.club/).
* We are [not](https://blog.codinghorror.com/can-your-team-pass-the-elevator-test/) paid to write code. We are paid to [solve problems](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/the-problem-you-solve-is-more-important-than-the-code-you-write-d0e5493132c6) and [sometimes](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-best-code-is-no-code-at-all/) that means coding.
* Data - Let's establish some OKRs and start collecting data. Keep data in front of you. How do we measure what we care about?
* [If it matters enough to be careful, it matters enough to build a system around it.](https://seths.blog/2018/11/quality-and-effort/)
* Don't be a Hero - [Problem Prevention > Problem Solving](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1218724150312751104) - Planning and [Pre-Mortems](https://hbr.org/2007/09/performing-a-project-premortem) rock!
* Be Assertive - Not passive aggressive or plain old aggressive. Tact and open communication go a long way.

## For those that work with to me profesionally...

### My Job
* Attract and retain world-class talent
* Set context and priority
* Remove blockers
* Advocate for the team with the rest of the company
* Be open to feedback
* Get to know the folks on the team and learn how to communicate the best for each person
* Help guide process to remove friction

### 1:1s
* We should talk regularly - once a week or once every other week.
* You set the agenda. What would you like to talk about? Whatâ€™s going well? Whatâ€™s bugging you?
* These donâ€™t need to be status updates unless you really want to talk about project status.
* I like [this](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/) format for our first 1:1 as I get to know you.
