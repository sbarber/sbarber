# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

## This is my README
*Working with Scott? Here's what to expect!*

Caveats:
* I'm pretty aware of my faults - this document isn't my attempt at excusing them.
* This document also [isn't an attempt to build trust](https://medium.com/@skamille/i-hate-manager-readmes-20a0dd9a70d0). That happens as we work together.

## Who _are_ you?
* [Small-town](https://cityofpage.org/) raised, lived-all-over, Millennial-leaning Gen-Xer (Xennial?) who loves [music](https://x.com/search?lang=en&q=(%23mixtape)%20(from%3AtapH20guru)&src=typed_query), cooking, dad jokes, and technology
* I'm pretty much [down the middle blue/green](https://www.wearebowline.com/blog/8-personality-types-a-deeper-dive-into-insights-discovery/). (Supporting or Observing Coordinator)
* I'm [ISTP](https://www.truity.com/personality-type/ISTP)-ish

## Guiding Principals, Things I Value
* Pragmatist - What will work for our team right now? People > process. Real [agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/)
* When it comes to human interaction, boring is bad. Emojis, gifs and cool project names plz
* When it comes to technology [boring](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology) [is](https://boringrails.com/) [good](http://boringtechnology.club/).
* Don't be a hero - [problem prevention > problem solving](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1218724150312751104) / planning and [pre-Mortems](https://hbr.org/2007/09/performing-a-project-premortem)
* Success really comes from consistantly [avoiding dumb mistakes rather than trying to be amazing](https://fs.blog/avoiding-stupidity/)
* [Dig yourself (and others) a pit of success](https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/)
* [If it matters enough to be careful, it matters enough to build a system around it.](https://seths.blog/2018/11/quality-and-effort/)
* We are [not](https://blog.codinghorror.com/can-your-team-pass-the-elevator-test/) paid to write code. We are paid to [solve problems](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/the-problem-you-solve-is-more-important-than-the-code-you-write-d0e5493132c6) and [sometimes](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-best-code-is-no-code-at-all/) that means coding
* Continuous improvement - Little by little let's make things better - small improvements are ok if it's consistant
* Process is good - when it's just enough to ease the pain and no more
* Written communication - helps solidify your thoughts (see: https://basecamp.com/guides/how-we-communicate #6 and #7)
* Overcommunicate - [No going dark](https://blog.codinghorror.com/dont-go-dark/) - It's ok to say things more than once
* Data - Let's establish some metrics and start collecting data. Keep data in front of you. How do we measure what we care about? "If you can't make engineering decisions based on data, then make engineering decisions that result in data." - Kent Beck
* Be assertive - not passive aggressive or plain old aggressive. Tact and open communication go a long way
